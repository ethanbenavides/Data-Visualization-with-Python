# Data Visualization with Python

This course teaches how to present and visualize complex data in a manner that makes sense to people and allows for insights to be easily seen and derived. This course makes use of several Python data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Folium to explore Canadian immigration data. It also covers dashboard creation using Plotly Dash, with a final assignment combining the skills learned to analyze and report US domestic airline flight performance in a dashboard.

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to data visualization tools
- Basic and specialized visualization tools
- Advanced visualizations topics and best practices
- Geospatial maps using Folium
- Dashboarding using Plotly Dash
